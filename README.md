# Project Azalea ACPICA fork.

This is a fork of ACPICA with [Project Azalea](https://github.com/martin-hughes/project_azalea) specific modifications.

It is licensed identically to the main [ACPICA project](https://github.com/acpica/acpica/) - information can be found
[here](https://www.acpica.org/licensing).

It can be compiled by simply executing `scons` in the root of this directory, but the easiest way to build a complete
system is using the [Azalea Builder](https://github.com/martin-hughes/azalea_builder).
